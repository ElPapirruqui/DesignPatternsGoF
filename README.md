# Design Patterns GoF

Here are some examples of different aproaches i was taking to implement several desing patterns i was learning.
Some of them doesnt have a main function to be called, as they only were created to just show how the code is implemented in certain scenario that the pattern will apply.
The goal of the different projects is to show how the different patterns could be implemented in a game like code environment.
